SapientNitro works closely with Panera Bread for their web presence and digital ordering experience across desktop, mobile, and in-store. I was the lead user experience designer for several projects **defining key ordering flows including check out and order setup.** We introduced design systems which tested better with users and were easier to build and maintain.

## Mobile homepage wireframes and user testing

In preparation for a national rollout of online ordering, SapientNitro is working closely with Panera to make the mobile site simpler and more ordering-friendly, while keeping legacy content. I am the UX designer, and the concepts were informed by our "Future cross-channel prototype" (below).

I am currently working with Panera and its customers to conduct user testing sessions at Panera cafes for the new mobile site.

## Future cross-channel  prototype

SapientNitro worked with Panera to develop a concept prototype for an integrated  design system for mobile, desktop, tablet, and kiosk. I was the UX designer and led the "ordering-first" strategic initiative which strongly influced the mobile redesign (above).

## Targeted UX optimizations

At SapientNitro, we also work with Panera on small, targeted adjustments to the web design system based on analytics and user feedback. Recently, we made the “Add to Cart” flow more intuitive with simple animations.
