We're either the smartest or the dumbest we've ever been. Karl Taro Greenfield on "Faking Cultural Literacy" in his *New York Times* op-ed:

> **It's never been so easy to pretend to know so much without actually knowing anything.** We pick topical, relevant bits from Facebook, Twitter or emailed news alerts, and then regurgitate them...

> What matters to us, awash in petabytes of data, is not necessarily having actually consumed this content firsthand but simply knowing that it exists â€” and having a position on it, being able to engage in the chatter about it. **We come perilously close to performing a pastiche of knowledgeability that is really a new model of know-nothingness**.

Brilliant and terrifying.
