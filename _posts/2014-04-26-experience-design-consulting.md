I am currently an Experience Designer at <a href="http://www.sapient.com/en-us/sapientnitro.html" target="_blank" title="SapientNitro.com">SapientNitro</a> where I research and sketch to design prototypes for large-scale websites. A portfolio of select deliverables is available by request.

###### Strategy & user experience design
## Panera Bread ordering experience

SapientNitro works closely with <a title="PaneraBread.com" target="_blank" href="https://www.panerabread.com/">Panera Bread</a> for their web presence and digital ordering experience across desktop, mobile, and in-store. I was the lead UX designer for several projects designing key flows including order setup, check out, and order confirmation. We introduced design systems which tested better with users and were easier to build and maintain.


###### User experience design
## Analog Devices website

SapientNitro recently worked with semiconductor manufacturer <a title="Analog.com" target="_blank" href="http://www.analog.com/">Analog Devices,</a> who will be launching a large redesign later this year. On the UX team, we defined the design system while working closely with the client to understand the business, with strategists to understand electrical enginners, and with business analysis to define requirements.



###### User experience design
## AlzForum.org

In 2012, SapientNitro worked with <a title="" target="_blank" href="">Fidelity Biosciences</a> to redesign <a title="AlzForum.org" target="_blank" href="http://alzforum.org/">AlzForum.org</a>. The organization was moving to Drupal to offer a cross-platform experience for their users and a more reliable interface for their editors. As a UX designer, I supported the design system, defined detailed interactions, and led the effort for editor documentation.
