I am currently an Experience Designer at <a href="http://www.sapient.com/en-us/sapientnitro.html" title="SapientNitro.com">SapientNitro</a> where I research and sketch to design prototypes for large-scale websites. A portfolio of select deliverables is available by request.

## Panera Bread

SapientNitro works closely with <a title="PaneraBread.com" href="https://www.panerabread.com/">Panera Bread</a> for their web presence and digital ordering experience across desktop, mobile, and in-store. I was the lead user experience designer for several projects **defining key ordering flows including check out and order setup**. We introduced design systems which tested better with users and were easier to build and maintain.


## Analog Devices

SapientNitro recently worked with semiconductor manufacturer <a title="Analog.com" href="http://www.analog.com/">Analog Devices,</a> who will be launching a large redesign later this year. On the UX team, we **defined the design system** while working closely with the client to understand the business, with strategists to understand electrical enginners, and with business analysis to define requirements.



## AlzForum

In 2012, SapientNitro worked with Fidelity Biosciences to redesign <a title="AlzForum.org" href="http://alzforum.org/">AlzForum.org</a>. The organization was moving to Drupal to offer a cross-platform experience for their users and a more reliable interface for their editors. As a UX designer, I **supported the design system, defined detailed interactions, and led the editor documentation**.
