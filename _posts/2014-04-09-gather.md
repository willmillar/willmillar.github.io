*Gather* is a concept service which provides a single access point for digital learning in schools. It connects assorted resources and tools to make it easy for teachers to construct their own curriculum in a way that works for students.

###### Challenge
## Classroom education was not built for a connected world

<img src="/images/gather-lectures.png">

The format of classroom education has changed very little over the past thousand years, despite fundamental advances in information infrastructure. The traditional *&ldquo;sage on stage&rdquo;* lecture format does not account for the fact that information is all around us. In a future where learning is no longer one way, we are not equipped to facilitate classroom interactions which bring in outside content in an organized yet open manor.


###### Process
## Learning from Blackboard, Salman Khan, and Bruce Mau

From Blackboard to Khan Academy, many brilliant minds are trying to crack the future of digital education systems. However, most of these &ldquo;learning management systems&rdquo; are rooted in specific tools, such as a resource manager or assignment tracker. I saw the need for a high-level layer which pulls all these desparate widgets together into a single friendly interface served on any device.

Bruce Mau&rsquo;s *The Third Teacher* focuses on the role of the &ldquo;teacher as designer.&rdquo; We need to empower teachers with powerful *education design tools* to choreograph their waves of information.



###### Solution
## Give teachers control by unifying learning resources

**Data-rich design.** Content is clear and unadorned. The ultimate goal is to show the data and hide the technology. **Clear abstraction.** Information graphic design is used as the primary communication tool. **Universal accessibility.** Provide the same experience across all devices: desktop, tablet, SmartBoard, tv, and mobile.
