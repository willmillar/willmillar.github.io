- Why does everyone want to copy the Apple Store?
	- Everything in the Apple Store is *intentionally designed*
- **Design is *the rendering of intent***
- *Imitation* is far less expensive and risky than *Innovation*
	- Imitation views design as a **commodity**
	- Innovation views design as a **competitive advantage**
- Businesses win when they are intentionally innovative
- **"I move things around until they look right." —Milton Glaser**
	- But design is about the *business,* not just the *visual*
	- Great business models are intentionally designed
	- Business needs designers *everywhere*
- **Map customer journeys on an axis of their emotions :) →:(**
- **“Innovation is not about adding new inventions, it's about adding new value”**
- Experiences should be mapped, measured, and designed
- Experience design: the rendering of intent within the gaps
- 150k job listings for UX design in the US

	- **"What separates out *the best* designers?"**
		- **Storytelling**
		- **Critiquing**
		- **Sketching**
		- **Presenting**
		- **Facilitating**
- "Innovation is saying 'No' to a thousand ideas before saying 'Yes'"
- **The rise of the UX generalist**
	- **Specialist:** Having more expertise in one area over others
	- **Generalist:** Having equal expertise in most areas
	- **Compartmentalist:** Having expertise in *only one* area (a career-limiting decision)
	- Being a specialist isn't about having the desire to specialize, it's just finding a job that pays you to work only in that narrow field
	- UX generalists need all of the skills listed above
		- Some claim that Experience Designers are Unicorns that don't exist
- **How to become a Design Unicorn:**
	- Train yourself
		- Read and learn everything there is to know about a skill
		- Learn the vocabulary
	- Practice your skills
	- Deconstruct as many good designs as you can
	- Seek out feedback (and listen to it!)
	- Teach others
		- You have to take the things you've internalized and *externalize* them
- Great experiences provide a competitive return on investment
- Teams need generalists more than specialists
- **Unicorns exist! You can become one.**
