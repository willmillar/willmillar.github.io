Sugata Mitra, Professor of Educational Technology at Newcastle University, from his TED talk ["Build a School in the Cloud"](http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_build_a_school_in_the_cloud):

> If you look at present-day schooling the way it is, it's quite easy to figure out where it came from... **Imagine trying to run the entire planet without computers**, without telephones, with data handwritten on pieces of paper, and traveling by ships...

> They created a global computer made up of people. It's still with us today. It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine. In order to have that machine running, you need lots and lots of people. They made another machine to produce those people: the school. The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine. They must be identical to each other. They must know three things: **They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten; they must be able to read; and they must be able to do multiplication, division, addition and subtraction in their head**...

> The empire is gone, so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people, and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it? Schools as we know them are obsolete.

This is exactly where my head was at when I was [thinking about digital learning platforms](/gather) at MassArt.
