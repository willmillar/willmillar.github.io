*Mathplus* helps math-inclined students identify potential career paths in high school. We want to help students in the job market by introducing them to successful professionals, practical applications for their skills, and example career paths.

## Defining the problem

The Design Research course gave us an open brief which asked we "identify a target audience in need and design a service to help them." Working from personal experience, our group rallied around the challenges of students transitioning into the workforce.


## Iterative collaboration

The key point in our process was choosing math-inclined students as our audience. After struggling to "solve careers for [all] students," we found that focusing on a more narrow audenience enabled us to identify individual needs and specific use cases.

## Putting it together

*The service was developed as a concept for Brian Lucid's* Design Research *at Massachusetts College of Art and Design.*
