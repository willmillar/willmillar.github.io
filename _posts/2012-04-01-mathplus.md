*Mathplus* is a concept service which helps math-inclined **students identify potential career paths in high school.** It aims to assist students in the job market by introducing them to successful professionals, practical applications for their skills, and example career paths.

###### Challenge
## Students struggle to connect skills and interests to careers

The *Design Research* course gave us an open brief which asked we "identify a target audience in need and design a service to help them." Working from personal experience, our group rallied around the challenges of students finding career paths.

*U.S. high schools average 1 guidance counsellor for every 450 students*


###### Process
## Narrow the target to focus on the problem

The key point in our process was choosing math-inclined students as our audience. After struggling to "solve careers for [all] students," we found that focusing on a more narrow audenience enabled us to identify individual needs and specific use cases.


###### Solution
## Connect students & professionals around relevant topics

Our focus helped us realize that the real disconnect is in how academic skills are applied to the "real world." Students are taught in theory, concepts, and experiments, but rarely in direct applications. We saw a service being able to connect the dots between skills and career paths. These connections would be reinforced by active industry professionals who could publish content and consult directly with students.
