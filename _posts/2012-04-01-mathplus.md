###### Challenge
## Students struggle to connect skills and interests to careers

The Design Research course gave us an open brief which asked we "identify a target audience in need and design a service to help them." Working from personal experience, our group rallied around the challenges of students transitioning into the workforce.

###### Process
## Narrow the target to focus on the problem

<img src="/images/gather-environment.png">

The key point in our process was choosing math-inclined students as our audience. After struggling to "solve careers for [all] students," we found that focusing on a more narrow audenience enabled us to identify individual needs and specific use cases.

###### Solution
## Connect students & professionals around relevant topics
