*Mathplus* helps math-inclined students identify potential career paths in high school. We believe that the earlier students get excited about applying their skills practically, the better they will do in the job market.

## Defining the problem

The Design Research course gave us an open brief which asked that we "identify a target audience in need" and "design a service to help them." Working from personal experience, our group rallied around the challenges of students transitioning into the workforce.


## Iterative collaboration

The key point in our process was choosing math-inclined students as our audience. After struggling to "solve careers for [all] students," we realized that we needed to focus on a small part of the problem in order to get more specific insights and break free of our overly expansive scope. Our experiences, as well as those of classmates, reminded us how challenging it is to apply such theory to real world jobs, especially when you're a student.
