Hi and welcome to CDGD 330: Interaction Design!

## Description
Basics in user-centered design, concepts, methodologies, and tools. Site mapping, wireframing, user personas, and flows for effective, innovative experiences.

An introduction to current concepts, methods, and technologies employed in the design of interactive media. Subjects of study include defining user and site requirements, managing information complexity, and designing visual interfaces that are usable and testable. Assignments address design problem solving within screen-based projects developed for various content, needs, and audiences.

## Approach
We will be **working together in a professional context on "real world" projects.** These projects will help **familiarize students with industry practices and deliverables,** as well as work through the fundamental concepts of *interaction design, usability, experience design, information architecture,* and the various methodologies that support said disciplines.

## Format
- **Lecture** *(30–90 minutes)*
	- Class updates
	- Topical discussion of Theory and Practice
- **Studio Critique** *(1–3 hours)*
	- 5–20 minutes per student
	- Student presents weekly progress on all deliverables
	- Class provides feedback on updated work
- I expect the course become more critique-focused and less lecture-focused over the semester as we dig deeper into project work

## Questions Answered
- *What makes a digital service great?*
- *What happens when you click?*
- *What happens in a user's mind?*
- *How do you organize information logically and usably?*
- *How do you effectively render intent?*
