 <p class="lead">I've always been fascinated with the *science* of pricing web/design work, but I've come to believe it's much more of a *dark art*. While the problem is largely unsolved in the industry, Richard Banfield, fouder of [Fresh Tilled Soil](http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/), wrote a great article that demystifies the current scheme and propopses a more helpful approach.</p>

Banfield argues that the "person hour" may not be the golden metric we've been pretending it is:

> The bottom-line is that **the ‘cost of time’ approach forces the industry to use billable hours as their sole basis for calculations.** It ignores the essential question of any successful project – was this the best use of my budget?

Ultimately, this brings us back to the industry's inability to define the ROI of good design. We use "time" as our only pricing metric because we cannot establish metrics for "complexity" or "quality." Hourly rates are often arbitrary.

> The hourly rates used by the web designers/developers undervalue their effort, and the client’s reliance on the comparative market rates simply reinforces this undervaluation.

So where does this leave us? Thankfully, Banfield proposes an alternate approach:

> A project’s value should be compared to the cost of what full-time employees (FTEs) would paid to do the same work. Instead of measuring the value of a project on the time it takes to build something, **the client team would measure the value based on the equivalent effort if it had to hire all of those people internally.**
