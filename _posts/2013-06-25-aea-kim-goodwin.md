Kim Goodwin, VP of UX at [Patients Like Me](http://www.patientslikeme.com/), former VP of UX at [Cooper](http://www.cooper.com/) on how "silos have been engineered to ignore one another" and scenarios help designers and organizations **"define problems as your users do"**

 <p class="byline">From her talk "Silo-Busting with Scenarios" at An Event Apart Boston 2013</p>

<!--more-->

- "Silos have been engineered to ignore one another"
- Dangerous ideas are "contained" inside of silos
- Defining problems within silos mean that solutions have to be narrow
	- You have to solve problems from a holistic user scenario level, rather than within your organization's silos
- Users are aware of the gaps between silos and land users in **UX purgatory**
- The best user experiences come from ignoring organizational silos
	- iPod won the market because it was designed for the whole ecosystem, not for discrete user actions
- **A set of scenarios is a great tool to ignore silos**
	 - "A plausible future story that stars a persona" who solves a problem on their terms
	 - Solve for *people,* not *roles*
	 - "Express users as characters that *we care about*"
		 - Wall-E is a robot, but is relatable because he has dreams, weaknesses, and personality
- Real humans have a range of needs
- **Good design processes oscillate between "Generative" and "Analytical" states**
	- **Generative**
		- "What could we do that would be awesome?"
		- User scenarios
	- **Analytical**
		- Requirements documents
		- User stories
- Scenarios can be used from the beginning of the design process on
	- Product definition all the way through to detailed visual design and implementation
- How do you get to a good scenario?
	- **Starts with user research**
		- "Forget what *you're* building"
		- Instead, listen to the person and understand how they see the world
		- Define your problem at your users' level ("I want a better travel experience") not at the level of your organization ("I want a new flight-booking system")
		- Ask specific questions ("Tell me about your last routine trip" rather than "Tell me about your last trip")
		- Have your user go through their current scenarios
		- **What are your users feelings along the way?** What experiences make you gripe? What experiences make you cheer?
			- Make scenarios by "unsucking" the bad experiences?
			- Reduce effort, anxiety, friction
		- **We want to make experiences delightful, not just usable!**
	- **Add something unexpectedly Good**
		- Ask "What would a helpful human do?"
			- "Imagine that your user has a proactive, smart assistant"
			- Delight your users
	- **Make it a story**
		- (Written prose optional)
		- Keep user's emotional state front and center
		- Integrates users' needs
	- **Discuss and decide**
		- "How much of this is behind bars, how much is worth investigating, and how much do we know we can do?"
		- [!] **"If the stakeholders said yes to everything, you didn't push far enough."**
	- **Look at your silo informed by the bigger journey**
		- Never forget to put your ideas in the context of the entire user journey
		- Pick several small 
		- **Use incredibly low-fidelity storyboarding to articulate**
			- Thumbnails — don't worry about the details — think about *structure* and *flow*)
		- **The sequence of the UI layout is defined by the sequence of the scenario**
		- Don't worry about navigation from the outset
			- Prototype out the flows, look for commonalities
			- Prioritize functionality as you identify opportunities for convergence
			- Top-level IA emerges from prototyping through scenarios
	- **Discuss and decide**
		- Develop roadmap to map out when certain functionaries are eligible for implementation
	- **Polish the details**
		- Scenarios work all the way down to the details
		- Ask what will other personas not understand? What will they need changed?
		- Visual hierarchy
			- Interaction designer can say "this is not emphasizing XYZ correctly"
				- This allows interaction designers to articulate need, but visual designer to create an original solution
- **"Scenarios are my 'desert-island' design tool"**
- **"Define problems as your users do"**
- Good things happen only when all team members who are responsible for *a part of the experience* take responsibility for *the whole experience.*
	- Your job isn't to "do UX" or "code a website." Your job is to work to provide users with delightful experiences.
