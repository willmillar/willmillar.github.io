Mike Monteiro of Mule Design and ["Fuck You Pay Me"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVkLVRt6c1U) on the role of designers and empathy for our clients:

> "[As a designer] you're going to spend 90% of your time convincing people that the shit you thought of in the shower is right."

*From his talk "What Client's Don't Know and Why It's Your Fault" at An Event Apart Boston 2013*

- "These ideas are only as good as you are at going back to your job and selling them."
- "If you are a designer, you are always convincing someone of something."
- "You need to take more responsibility for how you do your job."
- "You cannot put the onus of your job on someone else."
- **Express empathy with your expertise**
- **"Designers, you are in the service industry!"**
	- Don't be that grumpy, rude clerk who waists his expertise on his lack of empathy
	- Client service: Don't be irritated â€” be empathetic!
- Making things is the easy
- **"You're going to spend 90% of your time convincing people that the shit you though of in the shower is right."**
- "If it helps you do your job, it's part of your job"
- The designer-client relationship is not at all a teacher-student relationship
	- Learn enough about each others' businesses that you can successfully work together
	- **Do not take on clients you don't respect because you can't empathize with those you don't respect**
- **Clients don't know when to get a designer involved**
- **"Eye-rolling is not a design skill."**
- **"As long as you insist on acting like a disenfranchised creative, that's exactly how you deserve to be treated."**
- "Stop waiting for an invitation to do your job"
- **"The work does not speak for itself"**
	- **Sell your service, not your work**
	- Look for the problem that you solved and **use your work as a prop to illustrate the idea**
	- Clients don't know the best way to evaluate a designer
- **Clients and designers find each other via referrals**
	- "Referrals are the most precious commodity we have."
	- Every job you do is a sales pitch for the next job
- Goods RFPs *do* exist!
	- Parts
		- Define problem
		- Potential constraints
		- Goals
	- The solution comes from working together, *not* from an RFP
		- "RFPs may be a client's way to tell you they're scared"
		- Work together to establish solutions
	- If you help write the RFP, you're in an even better position to get the work
	- Help clients define a process that works well for both sides
	- RFPs are just another design problem to solve
- Don't just answer your client's questions, figure out why they're asking those questions
- **"Never work for someone you can't argue with"**
	- "Never work from somebody you can't say 'No' to"
- "Don't make your pricing a secret. Make it a datapoint."
- **"Your process is a mystery to most clients"**
	- What can you do to demystify design process?
	- It's *on you* to help your clients understand your process
- **"Do everything in your power to be right, but never be afraid to be wrong."**
- When you say "The client doesn't get it," you're saying "I couldn't find a way to get my point across"
- **"Everything that is wrong with design today is your fault." And that is good news, because it's your job to fix it.**
