SapientNitro recently worked with semiconductor manufacturer Analog Devices, who will be launching a large redesign later this year. On the UX team, we **defined the design system** while working closely with the client to understand the business, with strategists to understand electrical enginners, and with business analysis to define requirements.

## Wireframes for navigation & page templates

International semiconductor manufacturer Analog Devices selected SapientNitro to redesign and replatform their website in 2013. I was a part of the UX team, which worked with the business to understand the material, with our strategists to innovate in the semiconductor category, and with business analysts to define requirements. We produced detailed wireframes for every unique page template. The site will be launching later this year.

## UX and flows for Analog Devices's circuit board designer webapp

SapientNitro also worked to optimize Analog Devices's "Signal Chain Designer," a simulation and testing tool for engineers to lay out circuit board designs. I worked closely with engineering managers at Analog to understand the context. We made high-level experience recommendations and detailed UX changes. Testing and feedback has proven that the new experience is easier and more powerful for users.
