		- Content Strategy for Mobile
			- See *Content Strategy for Mobile* for A Book Apart
			- Actionable steps
				1. Understand the workflows for content creation and publishing in your organization
					- "Time to make the content!"
					- Web and mobile teams should not be siloed!
					- So much of the time, the mobile site is *better,* so why isn't it the website for everyone?
				2. "Write better. You can do this right now."
					- "There's no such thing as 'how to write for mobile.' There's just good writing."
					- Less jargon, declarative sentences, etc.
					- Case study: *American Cancer Society*
					- "Good content transcends platform."
					- Mobile is a good chance to clean up your crappy content
				3. Chunk your content appropriately
					- "Chunk your blobs"
					- Which content should we include or exclude?
					- Should long pages be broken into shorter ones?
					- Will it work to reuse headings as links?
					- Will it work to truncate body copy for teasers?
					- What fallbacks can we provide if our desktop content fails?
					- "Responsive design won't fix your content problem."
					- A package of image crops
						- How would you do this for text?
						- **Truncating headlines is just wrong**
						- See "Guardian Truncation Team"
						- Write shorter versions of headlines?
							- **Length:** 60 characters, 100 characters, 200 characters
							- **Tone & style:** SEO-optimized, colloquial
							- Superheads and subheads
							- Write multiple redundant versions of copy to avoid constant truncation
				- You need to provide enough context for users to confidently make a decision and not worry that they are going down the wrong path
					- Comcast uses subtext under headlines to help provide context to users
					- "Don't create content for a specific context. Think about it as a flexible, reusable system. You don't get to decide which device people use to access your content. They do."
