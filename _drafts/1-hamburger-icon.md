 <p class="lead">It's the morning after, and we designers are waking up next to three obscure horizontal lines. Known by its street names, the "hamburger," "pancakes," or "meat stack" icon spread through mainstream UI like wildfire, and now we're second guessing ourselves [for good reason](TKTKTK).</p>

In our defense, we were drunk on [responsive patterns](TKTKTK) and thought we were doing the right thing. In fact, I have recommended hamburger-based mobile navigation on all of my professional projects thusfar. At the time, the designers loved it, the clients loved it, and the devolopers had no trouble with them. Everyone's happy, right?

## Hamburger icon navigation hides your content

The tide seems to be turning on these hide-everything pull-out menus. Several influential [analytics reports](TKTKTK) and [usability studies](TKTKTK) have shown that this approach dramatically decreases use of the items inside these menus. This is why I now fancy calling it a *feature-hider* instead of a *menu icon*. You are taking *all* of your valuable content and functionality, and hiding it behind an obscure icon. Oops!

## We've been through this before

This isn't a new problem in design. If you can remember last time, we got drunk on [carousels](TKTKTK). They solved the problem of "too much stuff, not enough space." However, they end up burying everything beyond the first page, and they are [not recommended](TKTKTK) as a usability best practice. 

Instead of the hard task of defining 2–3 critical actions or desitations, 


## Designer-centered design
<!-- carousels -->

The problem with the hamburger icon is that it solves the navigation problem on the designer's and the business's terms, not the user's terms.

> As designers, we’ve taken to use the icon in applications and responsive web design to represent navigation, menus and extra information and if that’s been done because it was ‘trendy’ in our own world then I’m sorry but we need to stop and pause for a moment.

> Our users want the most important things in our app’s and websites to visible so they can be used and navigated without it being confusing. Let’s not just throw that stuff behind an ‘that’ icon because everyone else is doing it.
