I watched *Ghost in the Shell* again for the first time in 10 years and found it much more satisfying. As a teenager, I thought the philosophical themes were "really cool," but now I find them worthy of deep thought and serious reflection. I was amazed at how the film uses artificial intelligence and hyper gendered cyborgs to ask questions about the differences between cognition and human life.

> Sure I have a face and voice to distinguish myself from others, but my thoughts and memories are unique only to me, and I carry a sense of my own destiny. Each of those things are just a small part of it.

> All of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience. I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries.
