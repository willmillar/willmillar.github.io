Goodbye CMS! willmillar.com is now running on static pages built by Jekyll. This means I can design from sketches instead of starting from someone else's templates. Divorcing the content from design was a very powerful change, and I had a great time getting back into code!

Jekyll processes my posts into the templates I designed with HTML and [Liquid](). This is ideal for my writing workflow because I can write in human-readable [Markdown]() in any text editor. No HTML tags to muck up the document or no stupid CMS WYSIWYG text editor to fight with.

The process improved my designs, writing, workflow, and throughput. And it was fun! The site built from [Poole]() with [Jekyll]() on [GitHub Pages]() with typography from [Typekit](). No extra plugins or hidden gems.

## Designing in code

While not technically responsive, the site uses single-column design with select media queries to render a speedy and attractive experience on any device.

I was at [Visualized]() and all the brilliant ideas were projects that people coded themselves. 

... starting with "Hello world" and building up was so much different than starting with a final mockup and building down...

<small>Commits to the [willmillar.github.io](https://github.com/willmillar/willmillar.github.io) repo over the six weeks of spare time it took to learn Jekyll and Liquid, design and build the site, and write the content</small>

Started with sketches. Moved onto visual design. Considered freestyle. Tried Squarespace. Considered Ghost and Wordpress. Landed on Jekyll. Found Poole. Fell in love.

## Getting started was the hardest part

The biggest challenge in the process was getting the plane off the ground! I had whipped up some designs in OmniGraffle for a new site late one night. They sat on my desktop for a couple weeks while I looked into WYSIWYG-style CMSs like [SquareSpace](), new blogging engines like [Ghost](), and traditional CMS systems like [Wordpress](). Eventually, I decided on [Jekyll]() for three reasons:

1. **Jekyll made me get my hands dirty with code.** ... and this is important because...

- **Working in code gives a designer superpowers.** Every layer of abstraction above code is a layer of control that you give up as a designer. This is not to say that abstract design tools make poor designs, but should be considered severly limited. Being able to strategically conduct the ebb and flow of a live coded design is a much different skill than making a polished static mockup. I also believe that code skills are more relevant and reusable for web designers than being really good at Photoshop (I speak from experience).

- **It looks like Jekyll is hear to stay** (at least for a while). GitHub Pages uses Jekyll.
