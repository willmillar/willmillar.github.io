 <p class="lead">I rewatched *Ghost in the Shell* for the first time in 10 years and found it so satisfying. As a teenager, I thought the [philosophical themes](TKTKTK) were "cool," but now they really blow my mind.</p>

TK identity TK

> "You talk about redefining my identity. I want a guarantee that I can still be myself."

> "There isn't one. Why would you wish to? All things change in a dynamic environment. **Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you."**

 <p class="byline">"Where does the newborn go from here? The net is vast and infinite."</p>

Artificial intelligence and hyper-gendered cyborgs ared used to ask questions about the TKTKTK difference between cognition and human life TKTKTK. Is self identity uniquie to humankind? TK copies TK

> **"A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems, and copies do not give rise to variety and originality.** Life perpetuates itself through diversity. And this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration, until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain."

> "Why continually repeat this cycle?"

> "Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system."

 <!-- > "Sure I have a face and voice to distinguish myself from others, but my thoughts and memories are unique only to me, and I carry a sense of my own destiny. Each of those things are just a small part of it.

> "All of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience. I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries." -->
