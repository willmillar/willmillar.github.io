I rewatched *Ghost in the Shell* (twice) for the first time in 10 years and couldn't find it any more satisfying. As a teenager, I thought the philosophical themes were "cool," but now I find them worthy of deep thought and serious reflection. I was amazed at how the film uses artificial intelligence and hyper-gendered cyborgs to ask questions about the differences between cognition and human life.
