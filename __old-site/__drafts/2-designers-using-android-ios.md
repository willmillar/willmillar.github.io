Designing for mobile without understanding Android design is as bad as designing a reponsive site without understanding mobile design.

> A designer needs to keep up with best practices. Best practices aren’t just on one platform.

> I’ve become a better designer because I have learned to see what the best of both systems offers (and worst practices).

> Only using one platform and not the other makes it hard on a designer to learn new design patterns.
