 <p class="lead">Rewatching *Ghost in the Shell* after 10 years was incredibly satisfying --- a true visual masterpiece. As a teenager, I thought the [philosophical themes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_Ghost_in_the_Shell) were "cool," but now they really blow my mind.</p>

*Ghost in the Shell* is the film the Wachowskis showed their producer when they pitched *The Matrix*, saying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(film)#Cultural_impact">&ldquo;we want to do this for real.&rdquo;</a> Artificial intelligence and hyper-gendered cyborgs ared used to ask questions about the difference between sentience and human life. Is self identity uniquie to humankind?

> "You talk about redefining my identity. I want a guarantee that I can still be myself."

> "There isn't one. Why would you wish to? All things change in a dynamic environment. **Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you."**

Technical replication-based systems are shown to be powerful and efficient in 2029, but lack the originality and preciousness of organic growth-based systems. Impermanence and imperfection may not be ideal, but they also keep us new, fun, and different.

> **"A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems, and copies do not give rise to variety and originality.** Life perpetuates itself through diversity. And this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration, until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain."

> "Why continually repeat this cycle?"

> "Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system."

 > "Sure I have a face and voice to distinguish myself from others, but my thoughts and memories are unique only to me, and I carry a sense of my own destiny. Each of those things are just a small part of it.

> "All of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience. I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries." -->
