###### Freelance outreach marketing
## MassArt Graphic Design promotion

*We Are Thinkers And Makers* is a 2012 promotional video for the MassArt Graphic Design program. Classmate Pat Bitchell and I were contracted to design a presentation for an outreach tour to design programs abroad. Our approach featured student interviews and project examples to showcase the talent, community, and resources of MassArt Graphic Design.

###### Freelance outreach marketing
## "The Rap I Listen To"

When I inventoried and analyzed the hip hop music I listened to, I noticed geographical groupings of lyrical themes. What happens when you take this kind of data-driven pattern identification too far? "The Rap I Listen To" is a 2011 video component to [Brian Lucid](http://brianlucid.com/)'s "Collection of 100 Items" project for *Information Architecture* at MassArt.
