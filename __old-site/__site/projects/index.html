    <p><!-- SapientNitro recently worked with semiconductor manufacturer Analog Devices, who will be launching a large redesign later this year. On the UX team, we **defined the design system** while working closely with the client to understand the business, with strategists to understand electrical enginners, and with business analysis to define requirements. -->


<h2>Wireframes for navigation &amp; page templates</h2>

<p><img src="/images/work-examples-analog-product.png" class="circle"></p>

<p>International semiconductor manufacturer Analog Devices selected SapientNitro to redesign and replatform their website in 2013. I was a part of the UX team, which worked with the business to understand the material, with our strategists to innovate in the semiconductor category, and with business analysts to define requirements. We produced detailed wireframes for every unique page template. The site will be launching later this year.</p>

<h2>UX and flows for Analog Devices&rsquo;s circuit board designer webapp</h2>

<p><img src="/images/work-examples-analog-scd.png" class="circle"></p>

<p>SapientNitro also worked to optimize Analog Devices&rsquo;s &ldquo;Signal Chain Designer,&rdquo; a simulation and testing tool for engineers to lay out circuit board designs. I worked closely with engineering managers at Analog to understand the context. We made high-level experience recommendations and detailed UX changes. Testing and feedback has proven that the new experience is easier and more powerful for users.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Digital learning platform</h2>
        <span class="post-date">May 2012</span>
      </div>
    </a>
    <p><!-- *Gather* is a concept service which provides a single access point for **digital learning in schools.** It connects assorted resources and tools to make it easy for teachers to construct their own curriculum in a way that works for students. -->


<h6>Challenge</h6>

<h2>Classroom education was not built for a connected world</h2>

<p><img src="/images/gather-lectures.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><small>Should preparing and delivering a lecture look the same as it did 500 years ago?</small></p>

<p>The format of classroom education has changed very little in hundreds of years, despite fundamental advances in information infrastructure. The traditional <em>&ldquo;sage on stage&rdquo;</em> lecture format does not account for the fact that information is all around us. In a future where learning is no longer one way, <strong>we are not equipped to facilitate classroom interactions which bring in outside content in an organized yet open manor.</strong></p>

<h6>Process</h6>

<h2>Learning from Blackboard, Salman Khan, and Bruce Mau</h2>

<p><img src="/images/gather-blackboard.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><small>Are current tools actually enabling the learning process? The education category is plagued by complex and unintuitive interfaces.</small></p>

<p>From Blackboard to Khan Academy, many brilliant minds are trying to crack the future of digital education systems. However, most of these &ldquo;learning management systems&rdquo; are rooted in specific tools, such as a resource manager or assignment tracker. As illustrated above, <strong>these tools are not friendly for teachers or students to learn and use.</strong></p>

<p>I saw the need for a high-level layer which pulls all these desparate pieces together into a single friendly interface on any device.</p>

<p>Bruce Mau&rsquo;s <em>The Third Teacher</em> focuses on the role of the &ldquo;teacher as designer.&rdquo; We need to empower teachers with powerful education design tools to choreograph networks of information.</p>

<h6>Solution</h6>

<h2>Give teachers control by unifying learning resources</h2>

<p><img src="/images/gather-diagrams.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><small>Consolidating the content model gives power and control to teachers</small></p>

<p>The key to a better system for teachers and learners is a <strong>unified content service</strong> which makes creating your own curriculum by snapping existing resources together. The curriculum materials could then be packaged as a presentation, longform reading, problem set, or test.</p>

<p><img src="/images/gather-sketches.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>This gives teachers a single place to plan curriculum, prepare materials, and manage student activity</strong>, allowing for more efficient planning and more customized material. In turn, students could access all materials through any device and seamlessly transition between using an iPad at home, TVs or projectors, and their own mobile phones.</p>
