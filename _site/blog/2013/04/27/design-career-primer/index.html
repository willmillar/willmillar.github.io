  <h1 class="post-title">A Design Career Primer</h1>
  <span class="post-date">27 Apr 2013</span>
  <p>Since graduating I&#39;ve gotten my fair share of emails that go something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Yo Will!</em></p>

<p><em>I [know/am] a whizbang superstar design student who is looking to figure out their post-design school potential. Can you hook a [brother/sister] up?</em></p>

<p><em>xoxoxo</em><br>
<em>[ Genius professor / Baller student / Beloved friend ]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I <em>might</em> be exaggerating, but you get the gist. Anyway, in the past, I&#39;ve tried writing single-paragraph one-size-fits-all design career advice pieces, but they all end up a whitewash of generic careerisms (<em>&quot;Do <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/find-the-thing-youre-most-passionate-about-then-do,31742/">what you love</a>,&quot; etc.</em> — it&#39;s pretty useless stuff). I&#39;ve also gone looking for some sort of overall guide to framing the concepts of design careers, but I can&#39;t find it — please <a href="mailto:willmillar@gmail.com">let me know</a> if this exists!</p>

<p><strong>This &#39;primer&#39; is my attempt to start filling that void by trying to provide a <em>wide-but-shallow</em> perspective on design career orientation. So I&#39;ve spent some time over the past several months putting together the knowledge that I collected from my professional wanderings so far into a primer aimed at undergraduate design students.</strong></p>

<h2>I. Warning</h2>

<p>It should be noted that while I have <em>some</em> academic and professional design experience, it is not only limited, but also provides notable bias to my perspective on design as a practice, industry, and career. Section <em>IV. Helpful Resources</em> has some good places to cross-reference anything written here. And if something still smells funny, <a href="mailto:willmillar@gmail.com">call me on it</a>![[MORE]]</p>

<h2>II. Job Shopping Criteria</h2>

<h3>Level of Commitment</h3>

<p>i.e. <em>In what capacity/on what terms will you be working?</em></p>

<h4>1. Full-time employment</h4>

<p>&quot;40&quot; hours per week[^40-hrs]; Salaried</p>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Reliable income</li>
<li>Benefits</li>
<li>Relative job security[^job_security]</li>
<li>Access to the company yacht</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Unpaid overtime is sometimes considered an industry-wide expectation[^overtime]</li>
<li>Highest level of commitment (if you are concerned about the fit)</li>
</ul>

<p>[^40-hrs]: &quot;40 hours a week&quot; rarely means 40 hours a week. Depending on the agency culture, your workload, and the company&#39;s overall pipeline of work, it&#39;s not unreasonable to expect to put in weeks ranging anywhere between 35 and 55 hours.</p>

<p>[^job_security]: I can&#39;t speak for other fields today, but there is really no such thing as <em>full job security</em> in the creative industry.</p>

<p>[^overtime]: It&#39;s good to set expectations about hours early on. This is a good, yet tricky, question to make sure to address in job interviews (but <em>not</em> informational interviews).</p>

<h4>2. Contract employment</h4>

<p>Defined engagement with an end-date; Can be salaried or hourly </p>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Paid by the hour (overtime! woo hoo!)</li>
<li>Often good pay</li>
<li>Less-permanent commitment than full time (if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>No benefits (health, life, etc.)</li>
<li>Can be harder to embed oneself in company culture (possible &quot;outsider&quot; effect)</li>
<li>Less job security than full-time</li>
<li>All taxes come out of <em>your</em> paycheck, so you can take home significantly less after taxes</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Freelance employment</h4>

<p>Self-employed arrangement; Salaried or hourly</p>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>You pick the clients</li>
<li>If you have the talent, experience, and business skills, you stand to make significantly more money</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Getting good, real clients is seriously hard (though a worthwhile effort)</li>
<li>Unless you are freelancing on or with a team, you likely have <strong>no one to learn from,</strong> which is not optimal early on in your career[^career_learning]</li>
<li>Like contract work, you pay your own taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>[^career_learning]: Learning is always super important, but it is especially important early on in one&#39;s career.</p>

<h4>4. Internship employment</h4>

<p>Defined engagement, often with an end date; Usually hourly</p>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Hands-down best way to gain experience, make connections, and impress employers without any level of commitment (don&#39;t have to worry about being &quot;stuck&quot;)</li>
<li>Can possibly lead to a  long-term engagement</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Little job security</li>
<li>Obviously, you&#39;re the lowest on the totem pole (but that&#39;s the &quot;price for experience&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Industry</h3>

<p>i.e. <em>What does this company do?</em></p>

<p>This is not intended to be an all-inclusive list. The following industries are just some popular destinations among recent design graduates. Also, remember that many modern companies aren&#39;t easy or possible to categorize into a <em>single</em> &quot;industry,&quot; and are often reluctant to so, which makes classification all the more difficult.</p>

<h4>1. Advertising</h4>

<p>Advertising/marketing can be an exciting field to get into. It&#39;s quite popular for design graduates for the alluring work, reasonable compensation, and networking/career growth opportunities.</p>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Invigorating culture; networking opportunities</li>
<li>Often large-budget projects</li>
<li>&#39;Idea-centered&#39; design</li>
<li>Cool funtimes</li>
<li>Great experience across multiple disciplines</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Often designing artifacts to market <em>other design objects,</em> rather than designing those products or services themselves</li>
<li>Depending on the shop and project, it can be less creatively stimulating than more <em>heady</em> types of design</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Interactive</h4>

<p>Design for interactive projects is growing and changing rapidly, and has lots of fascinating opportunities that provide unique challenges, especially if you&#39;re able and willing to get your hands dirty.</p>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Digital continues to be &quot;The Thing&quot; in <em>every</em> industry; some of the most cutting-edge world-changing work happens in digital</li>
<li>Dynamic media jobs (i.e. web, tools, apps, etc...) often have higher compensation than designing counterparts for print media</li>
<li>Because of their large scale, interactive projects are great to stretch your role and get experience outside of your traditional comfort zone</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Often highly complex projects</li>
<li>Not unlike  print work, digital design processes involve a high level of detail-oriented grind</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Print and Traditional Graphic Design</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The print design industry is relatively outside of my professional wheelhouse, so I am certainly the most qualified person to comment on it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>All the beautiful, fun, and creative stuff you learned in art school at a super-professional level!</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>The print industry is slowly but steadily drying up and work is becoming more challenging to find</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Various Media Client-side</h4>

<p>TV/video, movies, magazines, etc. all have scores of designers working on their products, but from what I understand, this industry can be about knowing people and being able to get to the right locations (New York or L.A.).</p>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Sexy work</li>
<li>Often great for your portfolio</li>
<li>Can be exciting and fun if in the right organization and role</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>In line with my comments about freelancing <em>(above)</em>, working for a non-design-focused company can make it challenging to grow and expand professionally, with less focus on things like research, ideation, and analysis</li>
<li>Can be pigeonholed as an &quot;<em>X</em>-designer&quot; (i.e. a &#39;web banner-designer&#39; or a &#39;Photoshop-designer&#39;) if there is little support for design career growth within the organization</li>
<li>Can require additional effort to connect and network with other designers</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Other Client-side</h4>

<p>Almost all businesses hire designers in one way or another. Many of the largest architecture firms, restaurants, consumer goods manufacturers, fashion and clothing companies, among others, have whole internal, &#39;in-house&#39; creative teams!</p>

<h5>Pros &amp; Cons:</h5>

<p><em>See</em> Pros <em>&amp;</em> Cons <em>above, although in a non-media company, there&#39;s a reasonable chance that the work could be less sexy.</em> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/your_mileage_may_vary"><em>YMMV</em></a>.</p>

<h3>Company Size</h3>

<p><em>These distinctions are relatively arbitrary, but it is a helpful framework to conceptualize the size company you would like to be at.</em></p>

<h4>1. Small Company</h4>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Can be a great way to form close relationships with talented and experienced colleagues</li>
<li>Tighter, cohesive working groups</li>
<li>More likely to get traction to initiate change within the organization</li>
<li>Easier to maintain high visibility within the company</li>
<li>Often easier to expand your role into other disciplines (good way to work your way into becoming a generalist)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Any <em>personality</em> or team-related issues can be amplified without all the &#39;buffer room&#39; present in larger organizations</li>
<li>While it is quite possible to flourish under the right circumstances, it can also be challenging to maintain professional growth if the organization doesn&#39;t have room for your role to expand or change</li>
<li>Can be scarce on resources (limited IT support, less dedicated resources for things like expenses and office services)</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Medium Company</h4>

<p>A &quot;Medium&quot;-sized organization is a great way to get a mix of the pros and cons of small and large firms <em>(see above and below).</em></p>

<h4>3. Large Company</h4>

<h5>Pros:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Likely to work on bigger, more widely-relevant projects</li>
<li>More brains to pick (lots of smart people to learn from)</li>
<li>Many opportunities to network, grow and learn</li>
<li>Exposure to a wide gamut of high-performing specialists in a variety of domains</li>
<li>Exposure to multiple styles of leadership, management, and organization</li>
</ul>

<h5>Cons:</h5>

<ul>
<li>It could be easy to get lost or remain at a low visibility within the organization (especially with lots of talented individuals) </li>
<li>Increased volume of workers and varied processes have the capacity to increase friction and inhibit progress</li>
</ul>

<h2>Role Title</h2>

<p><em>It should be noted that the average college design graduate begins with a &quot;Junior&quot; or &quot;Intern&quot; title, though it is not impossible to land a more mid-level job out of school. And of course it should be noted that titles vary from company to company and there are many variations and misuses of title.</em></p>

<h4>Art Director</h4>

<li><strong>Works with:</strong> Concepts, styles, directions</li>
<li><strong>Essential tools:</strong> Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign</li>
</ul>

<h1>III. Important Focus Areas</h1>

<h2>How Do I Get a Job?!</h2>

<h4>1. Work</h4>

<p>Obviously there is no substitute for great work. Doing your best on your project work is the surest way to communicate your employability, and it is always a worthwhile endeavor. That being said, don&#39;t let your classwork overrun your ability to develop your <strong>networking</strong> and <strong>soft skills</strong>.</p>

<h4>2. Network</h4>

<p>From what I understand, most viable job leads come from personal connections. Now this doesn&#39;t mean that you are best friends with someone. This just means that maybe you would recognize this person if you bumped into them at an event. I know plenty of people who got great job leads through various portfolio reviews (popular reviews are run by AIGA, <a href="http://www.adcglobal.org/education/portfolio/">Art Directors&#39; Club</a>, and <a href="http://www.behance.net/reviews">Behance</a>, among other design groups). Also, follow local design groups (such as <a href="http://www.aiga.org/chapters/">your local AIGA chapter</a>) to get notified of upcoming local design events.</p>

<h4>3. Develop &quot;Soft Skills&quot;</h4>

<p>Put it all in a pretty package! <a href="http://justcreative.com/2008/10/02/design-elevator-speeches/">Develop and rehearse</a> <a href="http://www.designsponge.com/2009/05/biz-ladies-09-the-30-second-elevator-pitch.html">an introductory &quot;elevator speech&quot;</a> for yourself and your work. A great presentation with smooth delivery can make up for even a <em>glaring</em> design error, without much luck required. There is <em>an unbelievable amount</em> of value in developing your own window-dressing (e.g. speaking and presentation skills, beautiful business cards, being at the right networking events or portfolio reviews, etc.)</p>

<h3>★ The <em>most important</em> consideration in finding a great entry-level job</h3>

<h4>Learning potential</h4>

<p>As suggested to me by my former professor <a href="http://www.brianlucid.com">Brian Lucid</a>, the best thing a first job could have is the opportunity to learn a lot. In a dream world, this comes in the form of mentorship and guidance; smart, talented coworkers with the dedication to promoting learning and growth; and wise leadership to keep it all going in the right direction. Coming out of school, there is no built-in learning network to propel career forward, so having an employer that actively enables your learning and development is truly an excellent benefit. </p>

<h2>IV. Helpful Resources</h2>

<h3>People</h3>

<h4>1. Your professors</h4>

<p>Chances are, if you had a decent design program, you have some pretty damn great professors! Reach out to them. If they&#39;re worth their salt, and you remain respectful (especially to their valuable time), they&#39;ll be glad to help. And while they mean well, it&#39;s never a bad idea to cross-reference their advice with other professors, as well as any industry professionals to make sure they know what they&#39;re talking about.</p>

<h4>2. Your peers</h4>

<p>Unless you&#39;re surrounded by a bunch of degenerates, the people around you are all doing this stuff too! Take advantage of it! Share contacts and intel (with discretion), share good resources and job listings, consult about opportunities, make a private Facebook group, do it up! Competition only gets in the way as much as you let it. Also, building your professional network (and your LinkedIn!) starts as early as you want.</p>

<h4>3. Working professionals</h4>

<p>You probably know at least <em>someone</em> with professional experience in art or design. They are great resources! Send an email or a Facebook message, or better yet offer to take them out for coffee or lunch if it feels comfortable and they can spare the time. Give them a sense of what you are trying to do and then let them give you whatever information they have gained in their experience.</p>
