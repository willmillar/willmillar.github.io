      <p class="center-text subtitle">The dark art of pricing</p>
    
  
  
  
    <span class="post-date">June 3, 2014 <a title="Permalink" href="/pricing-design">&bull;</a></span>
  
  <p> <p class="lead">I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated with the <em>science</em> of pricing web/design work, but I&rsquo;ve come to believe it&rsquo;s much more of a <em>dark art</em>. While the problem is largely unsolved in the industry, Richard Banfield, co-fouder of <a href="http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/">Fresh Tilled Soil</a>, wrote a great article that demystifies the current scheme and propopses a more helpful approach.</p></p>

<p>Banfield argues that the &ldquo;person hour&rdquo; may not be the golden metric we&rsquo;ve been pretending it is:</p>

<blockquote><p>The bottom-line is that <strong>the ‘cost of time’ approach forces the industry to use billable hours as their sole basis for calculations.</strong> It ignores the essential question of any successful project – was this the best use of my budget?</p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, this brings us back to the inability to define the ROI of good design. We use &ldquo;time&rdquo; as our only pricing metric because we cannot establish metrics for &ldquo;complexity&rdquo; or &ldquo;quality.&rdquo; Hourly rates are often arbitrary.</p>

<blockquote><p>The hourly rates used by the web designers/developers undervalue their effort, and the client’s reliance on the comparative market rates simply reinforces this undervaluation.</p></blockquote>

<p>So where does this leave us? Thankfully, Banfield proposes an alternate approach:</p>

<blockquote><p>A project’s value should be compared to the cost of what full-time employees would paid to do the same work. Instead of measuring the value of a project on the time it takes to build something, <strong>the client team would measure the value based on the equivalent effort if it had to hire all of those people internally.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one. Why would you wish to? All things change in a dynamic environment. <strong>Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Recently I rewatched <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> for the first time in 10 years and found it very satisfying. As a teenager, I thought the <a href="">philosophical themes</a> were &ldquo;cool,&rdquo; but now they really blow my mind. Artificial intelligence and hyper-gendered cyborgs ared used to ask questions about the TK difference between cognition and human life TK. Is self identity uniquie to humankind?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re either the smartest or the dumbest we&rsquo;ve ever been. Karl Taro Greenfield on &ldquo;Faking Cultural Literacy&rdquo; in his <em>New York Times</em> op-ed:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>It&rsquo;s never been so easy to pretend to know so much without actually knowing anything.</strong> We pick topical, relevant bits from Facebook, Twitter or emailed news alerts, and then regurgitate them&hellip;</p>

<p>What matters to us, awash in petabytes of data, is not necessarily having actually consumed this content firsthand but simply knowing that it exists — and having a position on it, being able to engage in the chatter about it. <strong>We come perilously close to performing a pastiche of knowledgeability that is really a new model of know-nothingness</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Brilliant and terrifying.</p>

  <p>Sugata Mitra, Professor of Educational Technology at Newcastle University, from his TED talk <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_build_a_school_in_the_cloud">&ldquo;Build a School in the Cloud&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you look at present-day schooling the way it is, it&rsquo;s quite easy to figure out where it came from&hellip; <strong>Imagine trying to run the entire planet without computers</strong>, without telephones, with data handwritten on pieces of paper, and traveling by ships&hellip;</p>

<p>They created a global computer made up of people. It&rsquo;s still with us today. It&rsquo;s called the bureaucratic administrative machine. In order to have that machine running, you need lots and lots of people. They made another machine to produce those people: the school. The schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine. They must be identical to each other. They must know three things: <strong>They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten; they must be able to read; and they must be able to do multiplication, division, addition and subtraction in their head</strong>&hellip;</p>

<p>The empire is gone, so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people, and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it? Schools as we know them are obsolete.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is exactly where my head was at when I was <a href="/gather">thinking about digital learning platforms</a> at MassArt.</p>

    <span class="post-date">March 27, 2013</span>
  
  <p>Since graduating MassArt, I get semi-regular requests for <strong>advice to design students looking to get traction in the professional world</strong>. I love to meet with other young designers, but I also wanted to summarize what knowledge I&rsquo;ve picked up so far to younger students to helpfully improve understanding of their professional possibilities.</p>

<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve tried writing single-paragraph templated advice, but mostly became a whitewash of generic careerisms (<em>&ldquo;Do <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/find-the-thing-youre-most-passionate-about-then-do,31742/">what you love</a>,&rdquo; etc.</em>). I&rsquo;ve also gone looking for some sort of overall guide to framing the concepts of design careers, but I can&rsquo;t seem to find it.</p>

<p>This primer is my attempt to start filling that gap.</p>
